# Solving binding energies for the ground state protease in SARS-Cov-2

This project has been developed during the QHack 2022 open hackathon.

### Team Name: 

Quionizers

### Project Description: 

This project computes the binding energies of glutamine in order to facilitate speedups in the development of novel Civid-19 vaccines. A protease is an enzyme that works as a "hammer", breaking down particles into smaller amino acids and polypeptides. These amino acids and polypeptides then form long chains, allowing the virus to spread within the host. 

Covid-19 contains a protease called glutamine (see image).

Therefore, by blocking the protease's receptors, we effectively halt the virus's ability to spread within the host. This can be done by reacting the protease with a protease inhibitor in order to stop this chemical process from occuring.

Current quantum hardware is not powerful enough to simulate whole macromolecules. However, as quantum computers get more and more powerful, so too will the ability to simulate molecular interactions. For this project, we simplified the glutamine molecule to create a so-called toy protease, in order to prove the effectiveness of quantum computers. 

The glutamine molecule is simplified to methanamine (see image).

By computing the bonding energy for the ground state toy protease, we can develop more sophisticated inhibitors that may be more effective against other Covid variants. One major way we were able to simulate the molecule was by using the Hartree-Fock approximation method, which allows us to approximate the wave function of the quantum system of specific molecules in the quantum level, like glutamine.

This [research paper](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/hf-intro/hf-intro.pdf) goes further in depth into the Hartree Fock method.
